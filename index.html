        Most recently, I have studied Java Web Development at Tech Elevator, located in Cleveland, Ohio. Tech Elevator is a 14-week coding bootcamp learning how to develop dynamic web

        I was employed by Tremco, Inc. from May, 1998 until May, 2017. I began my career at Tremco as a temp on a two week assignment and ended up staying almost two decades. 
         I was hired on as a Production Associate to operate a rubber extrusion line. After a few years, I decided to further my education and obtained a degree in electrical engineering
         while still working 50-60 hours a week. Once I finished my degree, I combined my new education with my existing skills and took a position as a Design Engineer.
         In this new role I worked with customers to design new products and approve them for production.  After a companywide downsizing, my position was eliminated but my skills
         were still valued by the company and I was reassigned. I next took on the role of Shift Coordinator, where I was resposible 
         for moving raw materials into place and removing finished goods from the end of the extrusion lines and into the warehouse. A large amount of paperwork was required as part 
         of this position, as every pound of raw material had to be tracked and converted into feet of finished goods.  My next challenge was to become the Quality Technician for a new
         product line.  We built a whole new process, from the ground up, using LEAN manufacturing techniques such as 5S, Kata, PDCA, and Kanban.
